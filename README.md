#### DATA STRUCTURE (INPUT / OUTPU)

> Data is loaded from a Toehold Sensor Database (data/2019-03-30_toehold_dataset_proc_with_params.csv) which is comma delimited table  having the following columns of DNA encoded sub-sequences: organism, sequence_class, sequence_id, pre_seq	promoter, trigger, loop1, switch, loop2, stem1, atg, stem2m linkerm post_linker, output	
> #### Input tensor is defined as (DS=Data_Style):
> **DS)**  Toehold Nucleotide Sequence <br>
> *NOTE:  Base toehold string sequence [0-144]
> *       GGG  - Trigger - Loop1 - Switch  - Loop2 - Stem1 -  AUG  -  Stem2  -  Linker - Post-linker
> *     [-3,-1]  [0,-29]  [30-49]  [50-79]  [80-90] [91,96] [97,99] [100,108] [109,134]  [135,144]    
> *     For training we select our input sequence vector start with GGG and concatenate everything from "Loop1" to "post-linker"... which is seq_SwitchOFF_GFP  = ggg + seq[30:145].
> *     Also, pre_seq & promoter sub-sequences are NEVER used because they are not converted into mRNA (is in the plasmid but > *     it is never in the functional toehold module), so it won't contribute in secondary structure at all. For this example > *     in particular we use DS_1.*

> #### Output vector is defined as:
> **OUT)** ON, Off &/OR ON-OFF State values derived from the experimental testing of toehold switch RNA sequence

#### PROBLEM DEFINITION
> To investigate if a deep learning network can be used to predict toehold switch ON/OFF functionality, because in that case it would suggest the network is learning secondary structure prediction that would be transferable to other RNA based problems.
